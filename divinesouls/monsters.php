							The Helmeted Horror is one of the guards of Colca Canyon with spear and shield and the power of lightning.
							<br/><br/>
							A long time ago, when there was a temple in Colca Canyon, it was the guardian of that temple but after the temple was destroyed, it did not leave the region and became the icon of terror.
							<br/><br/>
							Beware these creatures are as tough as they look. Approach with caution.

							<b class="monsters-b">Steam Anthropoid</b></br><br />
							A kind of monster created by injecting the forbidden power of magic into a Gorilla. This artificial monster was created in Grauld. By attaching the Steam engine to its body, it maximized the inherent destructive power of a Gorilla.
							<br/><br/>
							Because of the forbidden magical influence and the pain caused by the combination of the body and Steam engine, this monster became violent enough to tear apart any creature it sees with its bear hands.

							<b class="monsters-b">Butcher</b></br><br />
							A Butcher is a monster artificially made by combining many corpses. It has a big body and great strength but low intelligence.
							<br/><br/>
							Butchers became hideous as a result of mixing and combining corpses, magic, and the sciences to create something truly terrible.

							<b class="monsters-b">Rhino</b></br><br />
							The Rhino is one of the experimental results of the magicians in Grauld. A
							<br/><br/>
							A Rhino's intelligence is similar to a dog as the experimenters used the genes and body of a dog.
							<br/><br/>
							Similar to other artificial monsters. the Rhino's body is combined with multiple mechanisms and weapons, able to attack its target from long-range with 3 harpoons.

							<b class="monsters-b">Necromancer</b></br><br />
							Necromancers study and use forbidden magic. They are categorized as Sorcerers but considered a threat because of the forbidden magic they experiment with, they are shunned by organizations of magicians.
							<br/><br/>
							Parts of their body decayed or deformed as a consequence of using forbidden magic. Now they can barely be recognised or called as humans.
							<br/><br/>
							Necromancers are supported by Grauld and Grauld continues to teach Necromancers.

							<b class="monsters-b">Carcas</b></br><br />
							A combat machine created by putting in magical power to a mechanical golem newly designed by Dr. Hildeun using a Zeplar engine.
							<br/><br/>
							It is composed of elaborate mechanisms and is not easily destroyed as it is operated by magical power. Highly destructive weapons are attached from head to both arms and torso. And its legs are replaced with wheels which enables it to move much faster.
							<br/><br/>
							Furthermore, it performs inputted orders without hesitating therefore if you ever encounter Carcas, it is highly recommended that you run.

							<b class="monsters-b">Rudolf Hess</b></br><br />
							Rudolf Hess was the general of Grauld and originally a human being. However, he offered himself as human subject for experiment to gain immortality.
							<br/><br/>
							Luckily or unluckily as some might think the experiment succeeded turning Rudolf Hess into a 'Half Zombie'.
							<br/><br/>
							Rudolf attached or combined multiple mechanisms everywhere in his body to become more powerful.
							<br/><br/>
							Because of the way his transformation occurred Rudolf still has his own mind, intellect, and wishes.
